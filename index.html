<p>Research is awesome! But today, due to several reasons, it is lacking some things and making some error during its 
development.</p>

<p>My objective with this project is to gather some tips and tools to improve how research is done.</p>

<h2>
<a name="version-control-system" class="anchor" href="#version-control-system"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Version Control System</h2>

<p>At some point of your research did you make a bad choice or a have done mistake and had to go back some steps? 
Of course you did. Research is not done following a recipe on some cookbook. Mistakes are done. 
One should try to avoid mistakes, but do not regret about it. Learn from it. </p>

<p>The problem that I want to address here is what can you do when do you do a mistake.<br>
You will probably want to take some steps back. If you are a very methodical person, you will have every step 
taken wrote down on some logbook or similar. But I guess that not everybody is like this. </p>

<p>Or maybe you keep track of changes like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd052810s.gif" alt="A Stroy Told in file Names" title="PhD comics #1323"></p>

<p>This is not an optimized way of tracking your files. I can see only one possible future to this and it is a 
totally mess.</p>

<p>So, why do you not try a Version Control System (VCS)?</p>

<p>A VCS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">"is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of 
information."</a> With this you can keep track of any change you 
do on your research and fallback to any point that you want.</p>

<p>One VCS widely used today is <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a>. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same creator 
of the Linux Operation System. Fun fact: like Linux, Linus named <code>git</code> after himself. Git is British English 
slang for a stupid or unpleasant person, and Linus said <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Why_the_.27Git.27_name.3F">"I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects 
after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."</a>. 
Git is free and open source. </p>

<p>You can try the basics of <code>git</code> <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">here</a> and this 
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">book</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/chacon">Scott Chacon</a> or this 
<a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000561/index.html">another book</a> by 
<a href="http://www.qoxp.net/">Richard E. Silverman</a> can also help.</p>

<h2>
<a name="backup-and-sharing" class="anchor" href="#backup-and-sharing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Backup and Sharing</h2>

<p>So do you want to do a backup of your research and/or work on multiple computers? You could try a USB stick or 
a portable HD. That is a way to do it, but maybe not the best. Maybe a cloud storage service like 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>. I would guess that 
this a better way to do it. Dropbox has a rudimentary VCS built-in. Maybe you want to share with your 
collaborators? You could create a shared folder on Dropbox.</p>

<p>But may I suggest something better. Something stronger.
<a href="https://github.com/about">Github</a>. 
It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">"is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control 
system."</a> You can store all your Git projects on Github and share 
with you collaborators. You can browse your and others research online on your preferred browser. 
Today you almot not need to know <code>git</code> to use it.</p>

</ul><h2>
<a name="bash" class="anchor" href="#bash"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bash</h2>

<p>You are doing your research on Linux, right? No!? Well, so you will probably want to skip this section. </p>

<p>If your are running Linux, you will probably have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> 
as your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Unix shell</a>. Some people are afraid of the terminal. 
Do not. The terminal is one of your most powerful ally. If you know it well and dominate it, what you can 
do is almost magical. </p>

<p>Talk about some commands and use of pipe to send the result of one command to another</p>

<p>e.g</p>

<ul>
<li>List files on one folder and send it to a file: <code>ls path/to/folder &gt; list_of_files.txt</code>; </li>
<li>Finfing files: <code>find path/to/folder -name filename</code>
</li>
<li>Finding files with RegEx: <code>find path/to/folder | grep 'add-your-regex-here'</code>
</li>
<li>Finding patterns inside files with RegEx: <code>find path/to/folder | xargs grep 'add-your-regex-here'</code>
</li>
<li>Removing files found with previous command: <code>find path/to/folder | grep 'add-your-regex-here' | xargs rm</code>
</li>
<li>Compare directories: <code>diff -rq dirA dirB</code>
</li>
<li>Convert all figures in a folder from one type to other: <code>for f in *.jpg; do convert ./"$f" ./"${f%.jpg}.png"; done</code>
</li>
</ul><p>Bonus Tip: <a href="https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt">Bash git prompt</a> is a resource that gives basic 
<code>git</code> information of the repository directly on the prompt.</p>

<a name="script-programming" class="anchor" href="#script-programming"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Script programming</h2>

<p>Talk how to use Script programming, specially about python.</p>

<p>You can learn python basics at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python">CodeAcademy</a>. I have tried and it is very 
nice.</p>

<p>Another interactive way to lear python is the <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/">learnpython.org</a>. Give it a try.</p>

<p>There is a tutorial for non-programmers <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the now famous <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>. It seems that it focus 
on exercise and repetion as learning tools.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/">link</a> and 
<a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/03/25/python-is-an-increasingly-popu#awesm=%7Eo98NZtqHzwYofe">this</a> contains a compilation 
of free books. </p>

<p>If you want to know which python modules/packages are installed in your system, you just have to type in your shell:</p>

<pre><code>pip freeze
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, this assumes that you have <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"><code>pip</code></a> installed in your system.</p>

<p>Installing python packages on your system could result on some headache. For example, I stayed on afternoon trying 
to figure it out why my package was not running after I reinstalled. The reason was that I was getting conflicts between 
the new and old version. The solution was to use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> and 
<a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html"><code>virtualenvwrapper</code></a>.</p>

<p>As the name says <code>virtualenv</code> creates a python virtual environment. This allows the user to install any python package 
without worryng in messing the system packages. Also, the user can create any number of virtual environments, for example, 
one for each project.</p>

<p>Write more about this.</p>

<a name="good-editor" class="anchor" href="#good-editor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Good Editor</h2>

<p>It is very important to have a good editor. </p>

<p>If you are the nerd-geek-kind-of-awesome guy, you should probably try VIM or EMACS.</p>

<p>Note to myself: Describe VIM, EMACS, Geany.</p>

<p>How to automate things using python. This is great when you do a miskate and had to run several things again.</p>

<p>Some links to check:</p>

</ul><h2>
<a name="negative-results" class="anchor" href="#negative-results"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Negative results</h2>

<p>Negative results are still results. Publish them. Why publish it? Just look the following cartoon and I guess you 
will understand.</p>

<p><img src="http://upmic.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/negative-data.png" alt="Negative Data" title="From the Upturned Microscope"></p>

<p>Got it?</p>

<p>Probably, a journal will not accepted a paper showing negative results. And because of this, enters 
<a href="http://www.figshare.com">Figshare</a>. 
This resource <a href="http://figshare.com/about">"allows users to upload any file format to be made visualisable in the browser so that figures, 
datasets, media, papers, posters, presentations and filesets can be disseminated in a way that the current 
scholarly publishing model does not allow.</a>
Each image, presententation or any other kind of data receives a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> that will uniquely identify you data and it will allow 
others to cite it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="visualization" class="anchor" href="#visualization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visualization</h2>

<p>Visualize your data is a very important step. I must say, crucial. It is very hard to obtain any results without it. 
Unless you are a statistic ninja, and even that, you would probably use visualization to convince your audience of 
your findings.</p>

<p>On of the fathers of this field is <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/index">Edward Tufte</a>. I have not yet read it, but 
hirs first book, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> 
is very highly recommended.
<strong>Write more about him.</strong></p>

<p>So, how one can visualize data? There are several tools available. You could use a spreadsheet editor, like 
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/features/calc/">LibreOffice Calc</a>. The resources are limited, but you can get a 
visualization quickly and it is very good when one does not have any other skils. And if you want to make better plots 
with it, you will probably want to try <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/">RAW</a>.</p>

<p>One can draw it by hand, or use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> or <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, for example. But, 
for that, it would probably be good to have some artistic skills. And also, if something change on your data, you would 
probably have to start it from scratch.</p>

<p>Also, one could code some routine to do visualization. The advantage of this method is that probably you will only have 
to code it once, i.e. the code is data independent. If the data changes, you only have to run it again. Well, achieving 
this will only depend of your coding skill.</p>

<p>There is several good visuzalization toolkits on the wild, like <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> for javascript,
and, for python, we have <a href="http://matplotlib.org/index.html">Matplotlib</a> and 
<a href="http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/">Mayavi</a>. If you want to learn D3, the book by 
<a href="http://alignedleft.com/about/">Scott Murray</a>, 
<em>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</em>, is now 
<a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html">available online for free</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/Bio">Bret Victor</a> is working on a software that will allow to dynamically draw your 
visualizations. If you want to know more about it, you can check his <a href="http://vimeo.com/66085662">talk</a> and 
<a href="http://worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum/">here</a>. It is really impressive!</p>

<p>And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/flowingdata">Nathan Yau</a> from <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">Flowing Data</a>, 
there is only one way to learn visualization: 
<a href="http://flowingdata.com/2013/07/12/getting-started-with-visualization-after-getting-started-with-visualization/">work with data</a></p>

<p>I also recommend his <a href="http://flowingdata.com/visualize-this/">first book</a> as a starting point to visualization. He 
address what type of visuazliation there are, the tools available and all on a very pleasant reading content.
I have not yet read his <a href="http://flowingdata.com/data-points/">second</a>, but I am very anxious to get a copy. </p>
